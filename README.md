# CS 255 Repo / Journal

This repo contains the requirements and design documents for the DriverPass system.

### Reflection
**Who and What:**

The client, DriverPass wants an application to build and application fills a niche
in the driver training market.  This application will provide a way for people 
learning to drive to get better training via training videos and in-car driving training.

**Things that went well.**

Overall, I belive the entire project went well.  In particular, the user's needs were straight
forward and documented well in the project description.  So, converting the customer requirements
into a requirements document was something I think went quite well.

**What would I revise?**

One of the things I would revise is the Gnatt chart.  I feel like the end result was decent but I 
had issues with lucid charts.  To improve it, I'd spend more time debugging these issues or use
a proper project management tool like to produce the chart and the related artifacts.

**How were the user's needs handled?**

The user's requirements were supplied by meeting notes from an requirements gathering meeting. 
Those meeting notes were carefully converted into a requirements document.  Once the requirements
document was approved by the customer, a design document was generated.

It's important to consider the user's needs when designing for many reasons.  First and foremost
we want to make sure we are designing and implementing a system that will enable them to solve
the problems they have or are seeking to solve.  Also, keeping user's needs in mind during design 
reduces costly re-work and keeps clients engaged and happy. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

My approach to designing software is to use Domain Driven Design.  This approach focuses on
the core are of knowledge required by the system.  Object models or domain models are built 
to capture the core complexity of the domain.  This means the design and development teams 
must constantly collaborate with domain experts to imporve and evolve the domain models.  Along
the way, requirements are captured and discussed with customers and domain experts and design
documents are constantly evolved.  The messiness of a BDUF (Big Design Up Front) is avoided 
by iteratively improving the domain model and updating and improving user stories.
